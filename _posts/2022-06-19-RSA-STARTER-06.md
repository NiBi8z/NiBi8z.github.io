### Instructions :

Sign the flag crypto{Immut4ble_m3ssag1ng} using your private key and the SHA256 hash function.

Cryptohack provides us a file named private.key


### Solution

I didn't do any writeup about RSA start 1 to 5 because they were very easy. This one is also easy but talks about signing with RSA which I had never heard of before.


We have a file with a private key: 

```text
N = 15216583654836731327639981224133918855895948374072384050848479908982286890723874753306371990452491305564061051059885803
d=11175901210643014262548222473449533091378848269490518850474399681690547281641491667690491585550160457893350536334242689
```

We have to hash "crypto{Immut4ble_m3ssag1ng}" with SHA-256 and encrypt it with our private key.


Short python code to solve the challenge : 
```python
from hashlib import sha256
from Cryptodome.PublicKey import RSA

hashed=int(sha256('crypto{Immut4ble_m3ssag1ng}'.encode()).hexdigest(),16) #Hashing the text and convert in base16 to encrypt it

file= open('private.key').read().splitlines() 
n=file[0].split('= ')[1]Â #parsing file to get n
d=file[1].split("= ")[1] #parsing file to get d

sign=pow(hashed,int(d),int(n)) #encrypt it
sign=hex(sign) #convert to hex
print(sign.split('x')[1]) #print result


```
